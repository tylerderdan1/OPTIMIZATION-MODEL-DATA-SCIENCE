# Internship Project 4: Business Optimization Models Using Linear Programming (PuLP)

## Overview

This repository contains two classic business optimization problems solved using **Linear Programming** with the **PuLP** library in Python:

1. **Product Mix Optimization**  
   Maximize profit by deciding how many units of two products to produce, subject to machine time constraints.

2. **Transportation Problem**  
   Minimize shipping costs from warehouses to stores while meeting supply and demand constraints.

The project demonstrates how to formulate, solve, and interpret optimization models for real-world business decisions.

## Features

- Clear problem definitions and constraints  
- Implementation of optimization models using PuLP  
- Step-by-step solutions with status checks  
- Visualization of optimal production quantities and shipment plans  
- Easy-to-run Python code for educational and practical purposes

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- PuLP library (`pip install pulp`)  
- Matplotlib for visualization (`pip install matplotlib`)

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/optimization-internship-project.git

## Insights

    Linear Programming is a powerful tool for solving constrained optimization problems.

    PuLP makes it easy to define variables, constraints, and objectives in Python.

    Visualization helps interpret and communicate the results effectively.

    These models can be adapted for more complex business scenarios.
